      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I’m <strong>Lungelo Brian Mhlongo</strong>, an aspiring software
        engineer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I’m passionate about building
        clean, interactive, and user-friendly web applications. Currently, I’m
        sharpening my skills in <strong>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>, and
        I enjoy exploring new technologies and problem-solving challenges in
        software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although my professional experience has been in hospitality-focused
        roles, I have leveraged that time to develop strong communication,
        teamwork, and time-management skills. These experiences and having to
        study while working have helped me become disciplined and adaptable—
        skills I now bring to my coding journey. I’m motivated by the idea of
        creating practical solutions that make a difference and constantly
        improving my technical abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong>,
        building projects that are both functional and visually appealing. I
        aspire to contribute to innovative teams where I can learn, collaborate,
        and grow while making meaningful software solutions. In the long term, I
        hope to create applications that solve real-world problems and inspire
        others who are beginning their own tech journeys.
      </p>
